>>To run with menu:

To run the simulation with the menu, first run the Setup.bat file (You only need to do this once to install the libraries used!)

After installing the libraries, you can double click the Run.pyw file to run the simulator with the GUI anytime.


>>To run the simulation in spyder with no menu:

Load the "simulation" module into spyder and run the simular() command, as per our report, you can modify the variables
by first typping the variable name and then the number to be set:

For example: simular(Ht = 2000), which runs the simulation with a limit time of 2000.

Aditionally you can start the simulation with specific arguments by just typing them into the position they come up in the function arguments.

For example: simular(8, 120) which runs a simulation with a size of 8 and a stating amount of "A" of 120.
